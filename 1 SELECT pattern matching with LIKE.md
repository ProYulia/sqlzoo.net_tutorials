Link to the page on sqlzoo - https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_from_WORLD_Tutorial

This tutorial uses the `LIKE` operator to check names. We will be using the `SELECT` command on the table world:

|    name     | continent |
|-------------|-----------|
| Afghanistan | Asia      |
| Albania     | Europe    |
| Algeria     | Africa    |
| Andorra     | Europe    |
| Angola      | Africa    |

```sql
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE 'Y%'
```

### Results

| name  |
|-------|
| Yemen |
