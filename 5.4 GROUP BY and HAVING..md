# Using GROUP BY and HAVING.

By including a `GROUP BY` clause functions such as `SUM` and `COUNT` are applied to groups of items sharing values. When you specify `GROUP BY` continent the result is that you get only one row for each different value of continent. All the other columns must be "aggregated" by one of `SUM`, `COUNT` ...

The `HAVING` clause allows use to filter the groups which are displayed. The `WHERE` clause filters rows **before** the aggregation, the `HAVING` clause filters **after** the aggregation.

If a `ORDER BY` clause is included we can refer to columns by their position.

## 1. 

For each continent show the number of countries

`world(name, continent, area, population, gdp)`

```sql
SELECT continent, COUNT(name)
  FROM world
 GROUP BY continent
 ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

|   continent   | COUNT(name) |
|---------------|-------------|
| Africa        |          53 |
| Asia          |          47 |
| Europe        |          44 |
| Oceania       |          14 |
| South America |          13 |
| North America |          11 |
| Caribbean     |          11 |
| Eurasia       |           2 |

## 2.

For each continent show the total population

```sql
SELECT continent, SUM(population) as "population"
  FROM world
 GROUP BY continent
```

|   continent   | population |
|---------------|------------|
| Africa        | 1016091005 |
| Asia          | 4342955676 |
| Caribbean     |   36149204 |
| Eurasia       |  149017400 |
| Europe        |  610261850 |
| North America |  518755156 |
| Oceania       |   37783477 |
| South America |  407618970 |

## 3. `WHERE` and `GROUP BY`

The `WHERE` filter takes place before the aggregating function.

For each relevant continent show the number of countries that has a population of at least 200 mln (2e8).

```sql
SELECT continent, COUNT(name)
  FROM world
 WHERE population>2e8
 GROUP BY continent
```

|   continent   | COUNT(name) |
|---------------|-------------|
| Asia          |           3 |
| North America |           1 |
| South America |           1 |

## 4. GROUP BY and HAVING

The `HAVING` clause is tested after the `GROUP BY`. You can test the aggregated values with a `HAVING` clause.

Show the total population of those continents with a total population of at least half a billion.

```sql
SELECT continent, SUM(population) as population
  FROM world
 GROUP BY continent
HAVING population>500000000
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

|   continent   | population |
|---------------|------------|
| Asia          | 4342955676 |
| Africa        | 1016091005 |
| Europe        |  610261850 |
| North America |  518755156 |
