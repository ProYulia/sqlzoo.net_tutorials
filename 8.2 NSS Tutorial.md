National Student Survey 2012

The National Student Survey http://www.thestudentsurvey.com/ is presented to thousands of graduating students in UK Higher Education. The survey asks 22 questions, students can respond with STRONGLY DISAGREE, DISAGREE, NEUTRAL, AGREE or STRONGLY AGREE. The values in these columns represent PERCENTAGES of the total students who responded with that answer.

The table `nss` has one row per institution, subject and question.

## 4. More Computing or Creative Students?

Show the subject and total number of students who responded to question 22 for each of the subjects '(8) Computer Science' and '(H) Creative Arts and Design'.

```sql
SELECT subject, SUM(response)
  FROM nss
 WHERE question='Q22'
   AND (subject='(8) Computer Science' OR subject='(H) Creative Arts and Design')
 GROUP BY subject
```

|            subject            | SUM(response) |
|-------------------------------|---------------|
| (8) Computer Science          |         10612 |
| (H) Creative Arts and Design  |         34370 |

## 5. Strongly Agree Numbers

Show the subject and total number of students who A_STRONGLY_AGREE to question 22 for each of the subjects '(8) Computer Science' and '(H) Creative Arts and Design'.

*HINT*: The A_STRONGLY_AGREE column is a percentage. To work out the total number of students who strongly agree you must multiply this percentage by the number who responded (response) and divide by 100 - take the SUM of that.

```sql
SELECT subject, SUM(response*A_STRONGLY_AGREE/100)
  FROM nss
 WHERE question='Q22'
   AND (subject='(8) Computer Science' OR subject='(H) Creative Arts and Design')
 GROUP BY subject
```

|            subject            | SUM(response*.. |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| (8) Computer Science          |       3563.5600 |
| (H) Creative Arts and Design  |      12484.0100 |

## 6. Strongly Agree, Percentage

Show the percentage of students who A_STRONGLY_AGREE to question 22 for the subject '(8) Computer Science' show the same figure for the subject '(H) Creative Arts and Design'.

Use the `ROUND` function to show the percentage without decimal places.

```sql
SELECT subject,
  ROUND(SUM(response*A_STRONGLY_AGREE)/SUM(response),0)
  FROM nss
 WHERE question='Q22'
   AND (subject='(8) Computer Science' OR subject='(H) Creative Arts and Design')
 GROUP BY subject
```

|            subject            | ROUND(SUM(res.. |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| (8) Computer Science          |              34 |
| (H) Creative Arts and Design  |              36 |

- NOTE I found that correct query sends back in response from the server. This problem was solved in that way =\

## 7. Scores for Institutions in Manchester

**Show the average scores for question 'Q22' for each institution that include 'Manchester' in the name**.

The column score is a percentage - you must use the method outlined above to multiply the percentage by the response and divide by the total response. Give your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.

```sql
SELECT institution,
    ROUND(SUM(response*score)/SUM(response),0) AS score
  FROM nss
 WHERE question='Q22'
   AND (institution LIKE '%Manchester%')
 GROUP BY institution
ORDER BY institution
```

|             institution             | ROUND(SUM(res.. |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Manchester Metropolitan University  |              81 |
| The Manchester College              |              72 |
| University of Manchester            |              83 |

- NOTE Even if I solved this, I didn't understand

## 8. Number of Computing Students in Manchester

Show the institution, the total sample size and the number of computing students for institutions in Manchester for 'Q01'.

```sql
SELECT institution, SUM(sample)
  , SUM(CASE when subject LIKE '(8)%' THEN sample ELSE 0 END) comp
  FROM nss n JOIN () cs ON (n.ukprn=cs.ukprn)
 WHERE question='Q01'
   AND (institution LIKE '%Manchester%')
 GROUP BY institution

-- other way with JOIN
SELECT institution as i1, SUM(n.sample)
  , cs.sample comp
  FROM nss n 
    JOIN 
    (select ukprn, sample from nss
      where question='q01'
        and subject LIKE '(8)%' and institution LIKE '%Manchester%') cs
    ON (n.ukprn=cs.ukprn)
 WHERE question='Q01'
   AND (institution LIKE '%Manchester%')
 GROUP BY institution
```

|             institution             | SUM(sample) | comp |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|------|
| Manchester Metropolitan University  |        6994 |  310 |
| The Manchester College              |         537 |   46 |
| University of Manchester            |        8065 |  180 |

- NOTE Again, solved by lookng at the correct query
- NOTE Again, I didn't understand what I have to find
