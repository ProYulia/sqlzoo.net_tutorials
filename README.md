# SQLZoo

SQLZoo includes tutorials and reference to support people learning SQL. Read more [there](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQLZOO:About).

## About files in this repo

Numeration of `*.md` documents is tended to match the original numeration of tutorials on [sqlzoo.net](https://sqlzoo.net).

- _Not all exercises are present_! Small part of them is omitted due such reasons as laziness, easiness, etc.
- There is `NOTES.md` describes problems (in my opinion) with some exercises.

## ASCII tables generator

For making nice-formated tables like this one:

|   continent   |  countries  |
|---------------|-------------|
| Africa        |          53 |
| Asia          |          47 |
| Europe        |          44 |
| ...           |         ... |
