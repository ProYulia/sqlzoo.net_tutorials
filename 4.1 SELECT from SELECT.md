# SELECT .. SELECT

You can use the results from one query in another query

## 1. Subquery with `FROM`

You may use a `SELECT` statement in the `FROM` line.

In this case the derived table `X` has columns name and `gdp_per_capita`. The calculated values in the inner `SELECT` can be used in the outer `SELECT`.

```sql
SELECT name, ROUND(gdp_per_capita)
  FROM
  (SELECT name,
          gdp/population AS gdp_per_capita
     FROM bbc) AS X
 WHERE gdp_per_capita>20000
 ORDER BY gdp_per_capita DESC
```

|           name           | ROUND(gdp_per.. |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Luxembourg               |           56230 |
| Norway                   |           52030 |
| Switzerland              |           48230 |
| United States of America |           41400 |
| Denmark                  |           40650 |
| Iceland                  |           38620 |
| Japan                    |           37180 |
| Sweden                   |           35770 |
| Ireland                  |           34280 |
| United Kingdom           |           33940 |

Notice that:

- the inner table is given an alias `X`
- the first column in the inner query keeps its name
- the second column in the inner query has an alias

## 2. Subquery with IN

**Find the countries in the same region as Bhutan**

You may use a `SELECT` statement in the `WHERE` line - this returns a list of regions.

```sql
SELECT name
  FROM bbc
 WHERE region IN
  (SELECT region FROM bbc
    WHERE name='Bhutan')
```

`SELECT region FROM bbc WHERE name='Bhutan'` finds the region of country 'Bhutan'. Then this result uses to find countries in the same region.

## 3. Correlated Subquery

If a value from the outer query appears in the inner query this is "correlated subquery".

**Show the countries where the population is greater than 5 times the average for its region**

```sql
SELECT name, population
  FROM bbc AS b1
 WHERE population >
  5*(SELECT AVG(population) FROM bbc
     WHERE region=b1.region)
ORDER BY population DESC
```

|  name   | population |    region     |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| China   | 1300000000 | Asia-Pacific  |
| India   | 1100000000 | South Asia    |
| Brazil  |  182800000 | South America |
| Russia  |  141500000 | Europe        |
| Nigeria |  130200000 | Africa        |
