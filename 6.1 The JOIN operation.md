## JOIN and UEFA EURO 2012

This tutorial introduces `JOIN` which allows you to use data from two or more tables. The tables contain all matches and goals from UEFA EURO 2012 Football Championship in Poland and Ukraine.

The data is available (mysql format) at http://sqlzoo.net/euro2012.sql

## 1.

The first example shows the goal scored by a player with the last name 'Bender'. The `*` says to list all the columns in the table - a shorter way of saying `matchid, teamid, player, gtime`

**Modify it to show the matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. To identify German players, check for:** `teamid = 'GER'`

```sql
SELECT matchid, player FROM goal 
  WHERE teamid = 'ger'
```

| matchid |     player     |
|---------|----------------|
|    1008 | Mario Gómez    |
|    1010 | Mario Gómez    |
|    1010 | Mario Gómez    |
|    1012 | Lukas Podolski |
|    1012 | Lars Bender    |
|    1026 | Philipp Lahm   |
|    1026 | Sami Khedira   |
|    1026 | Miroslav Klose |
|    1026 | Marco Reus     |
|    1030 | Mesut Özil     |

## 2.

From the previous query you can see that Lars Bender's scored a goal in game 1012. Now we want to know what teams were playing in that match.

Notice in the that the column `matchid` in the `goal` table corresponds to the `id` column in the `game` table. We can look up information about game 1012 by finding that row in the game table.

**Show id, stadium, team1, team2 for just game 1012**

```sql
SELECT id,stadium,team1,team2
  FROM game
where id = 1012
```

|  id  |  stadium   | team1 | team2 |
|------|------------|-------|-------|
| 1012 | Arena Lviv | DEN   | GER   |

## 3.

You can combine the two steps into a single query with a `JOIN`.

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
```

The `FROM` clause says to merge data from the goal table with that from the game table. The `ON` says how to figure out which rows in `game` go with which rows in `goal` - the `matchid` from goal must match `id` from `game`. (If we wanted to be more clear/specific we could say
`ON (game.id=goal.matchid)`

The code below shows the player (from the goal) and stadium name (from the game table) for every goal scored.

**Modify it to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal**.

```sql
SELECT player,teamid,stadium,mdate
  FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
  where teamid = 'ger'
```

|     player     | teamid |         stadium          |    mdate     |
|----------------|--------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Mario Gómez    | GER    | Arena Lviv               | 9 June 2012  |
| Mario Gómez    | GER    | Metalist Stadium         | 13 June 2012 |
| Mario Gómez    | GER    | Metalist Stadium         | 13 June 2012 |
| Lukas Podolski | GER    | Arena Lviv               | 17 June 2012 |
| Lars Bender    | GER    | Arena Lviv               | 17 June 2012 |
| Philipp Lahm   | GER    | PGE Arena Gdansk         | 22 June 2012 |
| Sami Khedira   | GER    | PGE Arena Gdansk         | 22 June 2012 |
| Miroslav Klose | GER    | PGE Arena Gdansk         | 22 June 2012 |
| Marco Reus     | GER    | PGE Arena Gdansk         | 22 June 2012 |
| Mesut Özil     | GER    | National Stadium, Warsaw | 28 June 2012 |

## 4.

Use the same `JOIN` as in the previous question.

**Show the team1, team2 and player for every goal scored by a player called Mario** `player LIKE 'Mario%'`

```sql
SELECT team1,team2,player
FROM game JOIN goal ON (id=matchid)
  where player LIKE 'Mario%'
```

| team1 | team2 |     player      |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| GER   | POR   | Mario Gómez     |
| NED   | GER   | Mario Gómez     |
| NED   | GER   | Mario Gómez     |
| IRL   | CRO   | Mario Mandžukic |
| IRL   | CRO   | Mario Mandžukic |
| ITA   | CRO   | Mario Mandžukic |
| ITA   | IRL   | Mario Balotelli |
| GER   | ITA   | Mario Balotelli |
| GER   | ITA   | Mario Balotelli |

## 5.

The table `eteam` gives details of every national team including the coach. You can `JOIN` `goal` to `eteam` using the phrase `goal JOIN eteam on teamid=id`

**Show `player`, `teamid`, `coach`, `gtime` for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes` gtime<=10`**

```sql
SELECT player, teamid, coach, gtime
  FROM goal JOIN eteam ON goal.teamid=eteam.id
 WHERE gtime<=10
```

|     player      | teamid |       coach        | gtime |
|-----------------|--------|--------------------|-------|
| Petr Jirácek    | CZE    | Michal Bílek       |     3 |
| Václav Pilar    | CZE    | Michal Bílek       |     6 |
| Mario Mandžukic | CRO    | Slaven Bilic       |     3 |
| Fernando Torres | ESP    | Vicente del Bosque |     4 |

## 6.

To `JOIN` `game` with `eteam` you could use either
`game JOIN eteam ON (team1=eteam.id)` or `game JOIN eteam ON (team2=eteam.id)`

Notice that because `id` is a column name in both `game` and `eteam` you must specify `eteam.id` instead of just `id`

**List the the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach**.

```sql
select mdate, teamname
from game JOIN eteam ON game.team1=eteam.id
where eteam.coach = 'Fernando Santos'
```

|    mdate     | teamname |
|--------------|----------|
| 12 June 2012 | Greece   |
| 16 June 2012 | Greece   |

## 7.

**List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'**.

```sql
select player
from goal JOIN game ON goal.matchid=game.id
where stadium='National Stadium, Warsaw'
```

|        player        |
|----------------------|
| Robert Lewandowski   |
| Dimitris Salpingidis |
| Alan Dzagoev         |
| Jakub Blaszczykowski |
| Giorgos Karagounis   |
| Cristiano Ronaldo    |
| Mario Balotelli      |
| Mario Balotelli      |
| Mesut Özil           |

- NOTE that "correct" asnwer has duplicates. So the better answer will be if one will add `DISTINCT` before `SELECT`

## 8.

The example query shows all goals scored in the Germany-Greece quarterfinal.

```sql
SELECT player, gtime
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
    WHERE (team1='GER' AND team2='GRE')
```

**Instead show the name of all players who scored a goal against Germany**.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT player
  FROM goal JOIN game ON (goal.matchid = game.id)
    WHERE (team1='GER' OR team2='GER') and teamid<>'GER'
```

|        player        |
|----------------------|

|-------------------------------------|-------|
| Arena Lviv                          |     9 |
| Donbass Arena                       |     7 |
| Metalist Stadium                    |     7 |
| National Stadium, Warsaw            |     9 |
| Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex |    14 |
| PGE Arena Gdansk                    |    13 |
| Stadion Miejski (Poznan)            |     8 |
| Stadion Miejski (Wroclaw)           |     9 |

## 11.

For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored.

```sql
SELECT matchid, mdate, COUNT(matchid) goals
  FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id
 WHERE (team1 = 'POL' OR team2 = 'POL')
  GROUP BY matchid, mdate
```

| matchid |    mdate     | goals |
|---------|--------------|-------|
|    1001 | 8 June 2012  |     2 |
|    1004 | 12 June 2012 |     2 |
|    1005 | 16 June 2012 |     1 |

## 12.

For every match where 'GER' scored, show matchid, match date and the number of goals scored by 'GER'

```sql
select matchid, mdate, COUNT(matchid)
  from goal JOIN game ON matchid=id
    where teamid='GER'
  GROUP BY matchid, mdate
```

| matchid |    mdate     | COUNT(matchid) |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
|    1008 | 9 June 2012  |              1 |
|    1010 | 13 June 2012 |              2 |
|    1012 | 17 June 2012 |              2 |
|    1026 | 22 June 2012 |              4 |
|    1030 | 28 June 2012 |              1 |

## 13.

List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use [`CASE WHEN`](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/CASE) which has not been explained in any previous exercises.

|    mdate     | team1 | score1 | team2 | score2 |
|--------------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1 July 2012  | ESP   |      4 | ITA   |      0 |
| 10 June 2012 | ESP   |      1 | ITA   |      1 |
| 10 June 2012 | IRL   |      1 | CRO   |      3 |
| ...          |       |        |       |        |

Notice in the query given every goal is listed. If it was a team1 goal then a 1 appears in score1, otherwise there is a 0. You could SUM this column to get a count of the goals scored by team1. **Sort your result by mdate, matchid, team1 and team2**.

```sql
SELECT mdate,
  team1,
  SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score1,
  team2,
  SUM(CASE WHEN teamid=team2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score2
    FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id
      GROUP BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2
    ORDER BY mdate, matchid, team1, team2
```

**There is no pair 0-0 in my results. How to handle it**?

The problem is: if there is a game **WITH NO GOALS** then there is no row in `goal` table. Thus `INNER JOIN` doesn't work and it is needed to use `LEFT JOIN`.
