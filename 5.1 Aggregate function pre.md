# Using SUM, Count, MAX, DISTINCT and ORDER BY

Link to the page - https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Using_SUM,_Count,_MAX,_DISTINCT_and_ORDER_BY

## Aggregates

The functions `SUM`, `COUNT`, `MAX` and `AVG` are "aggregates", each may be applied to a numeric attribute resulting in a single row being returned by the query. (These functions are even more useful when used with the `GROUP BY` clause.)

**The total population and GDP of Europe.**

```sql
SELECT SUM(population), SUM(gdp)
  FROM bbc
  WHERE region = 'Europe'
```

| SUM(populatio.. |    SUM(gdp)    |
|-----------------|----------------|
|       818020000 | 13193474540000 |

## Distinct

By default the result of a `SELECT` may contain duplicate rows. We can remove these duplicates using the `DISTINCT` key word.

**What are the regions?**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT region FROM bbc
```

|    region     |
|---------------|
| Africa        |
| Americas      |
| Asia-Pacific  |
| Europe        |
| Middle East   |
| North America |
| South America |
| South Asia    |

## Order by

`ORDER BY` permits us to see the result of a `SELECT` in any particular order. We may indicate `ASC` or `DESC` for ascending (smallest first, largest last) or descending order.

**Show the name and population for each country with a population of more than 1e8. Show countries in descending order of population.**

```sql
SELECT name, population
  FROM bbc
  WHERE population > 1e8
  ORDER BY population DESC
```

|           name           | population |
|--------------------------|------------|
| China                    | 1300000000 |
| India                    | 1100000000 |
| United States of America |  295000000 |
| Indonesia                |  225300000 |
| Brazil                   |  182800000 |
| Pakistan                 |  161100000 |
| Bangladesh               |  152600000 |
| Russia                   |  141500000 |
| Nigeria                  |  130200000 |
| Japan                    |  127900000 |
| Mexico                   |  106400000 |

Show the average population and gdp of countries in Europe

```sql
select ROUND(avg(population), -6) as "population, mln", ROUND(avg(gdp), -6) as "gdp, mln"
from world
where continent='Europe'
```

| population, m.. |   gdp, mln   |
|-----------------|--------------|
|        14000000 | 436770000000 |
