# Using nested SELECT

## 1. Using SELECT in SELECT

The result of a `SELECT` statement may be used as a value in another statement. For example the statement `SELECT continent FROM world WHERE name = 'Brazil'` evaluates to 'South America' so we can use this value to obtain a list of all countries in the same continent as 'Brazil'.

List each country in the same continent as 'Brazil'.

```sql
-- selects the continent of Brazil
SELECT continent FROM world WHERE name = 'Brazil'

SELECT name FROM world
WHERE continent = (SELECT continent FROM world WHERE name = 'Brazil');
```

|               name               |
|----------------------------------|
| Argentina                        |
| Bolivia                          |
| Brazil                           |
| Chile                            |
| Colombia                         |
| Ecuador                          |
| Guyana                           |
| Paraguay                         |
| Peru                             |
| Saint Vincent and the Grenadines |
| Suriname                         |
| Uruguay                          |
| Venezuela                        |

### Alias

Some versions of SQL insist that you give the subquery an alias. Simply put `AS` somename after the closing bracket:

```sql
SELECT name FROM world WHERE continent =
  (SELECT continent FROM world WHERE name='Brazil') AS brazil_continent
```

## 2. Multiple Results

The subquery may return more than one result - if this happens the query above will fail as you are testing one value against more than one value. It is safer to use `IN` to cope with this possibility.

**List each country and its continent in the same continent as 'Brazil' or 'Mexico'.**

```sql
SELECT name, continent FROM world
WHERE continent IN
  (SELECT continent 
     FROM world WHERE name='Brazil'
                   OR name='Mexico')
```

## 3. Subquery on the SELECT line

If you are certain that only one value will be returned you can use that query on the SELECT line.

**Show the population of China as a multiple of the population of the United Kingdom**

```sql
SELECT
 population/(SELECT population FROM world
             WHERE name='United Kingdom') as "chineses"
  FROM world
WHERE name = 'China'
```

| chineses |
|----------|
|  21.2987 |

## 4. Operators over a set

    =     equals
    >     greater than
    <     less than
    >=    greater or equal
    <=    less or equal

You can use the words `ALL` or `ANY` where the right side of the operator might have multiple values.

**Show each country that has a population greater than the population of ALL countries in Europe.**

Note that we mean greater than every single country in Europe; not the combined population of Europe.

```sql
SELECT name, population FROM world
 WHERE population > ALL
      (SELECT population FROM world
        WHERE continent='Europe')
ORDER BY population DESC
```

Note `ALL` . It looks like "give me the MAXIMUM possible value from a set".
