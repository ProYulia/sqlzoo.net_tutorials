## 7. Largest in each continent

We can refer to values in the outer SELECT within the inner SELECT. We can name the tables so that we can tell the difference between the inner and outer versions.

**Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area.**

```sql
SELECT continent, name as country, area FROM world AS x
  WHERE area >= ALL
    (SELECT area FROM world AS y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent
          AND area > 0)
ORDER BY continent
```

|   continent   |  country   |   area   |
|---------------|------------|----------|
| Africa        | Algeria    |  2381741 |
| Asia          | China      |  9596961 |

| Oceania       | Australia  |  7692024 |
| South America | Brazil     |  8515767 |

**Find the largest country (by population) in each continent.**

```sql
SELECT continent, name, population FROM world x
  WHERE population >= ALL
    (SELECT population FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent
          AND population>0)
ORDER BY continent
```

|   continent   |     name      | population |
|---------------|---------------|------------|

## 8. First country of each continent (alphabetically)

List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically. (Find the first country in each continent)

    (SELECT name FROM world AS y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent
    )
```

|   continent   |        name         |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Africa        | Algeria             |
| Asia          | Afghanistan         |

## 9.

Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.

```sql

    ALL(select population from world AS y
        where x.continent=y.continent);
```

### How I solved this

First, I found `the continents where all countries have a population <= 25e6`

```sql
select continent from world AS x
where 25e6 >=
    ALL(select population from world AS y
        where x.continent=y.continent);
```

Then I modified the query to find `Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents`.

## 10. 

Some countries have populations more than three times that of any of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.

```sql
select name, continent 
from world AS x
where population > ALL(
    select population*3 
    from world AS y 
        where x.continent=y.continent AND x.name != y.name)
```

|   name    |   continent   |
|-----------|---------------|
| Australia | Oceania       |
| Brazil    | South America |
| Russia    | Eurasia       |
