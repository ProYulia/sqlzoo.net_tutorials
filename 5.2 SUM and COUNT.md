## 7. Counting big countries in each continent

group by continent
```

|   continent   | countries |
|---------------|-----------|
| Africa        |        29 |
| Asia          |        26 |

## 8. Counting big continents

```sql
select continent, SUM(population) as population from world
group by continent
HAVING SUM(population) >= 100e6
ORDER BY population DESC
```

|   continent   | population |
|---------------|------------|
| Asia          | 4342955676 |
